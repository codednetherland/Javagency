[version]
The API here may change once in a while until the version 0.9 is complete.
If this happens a tag will show up and mark it.
Then maybe some issues or request to chang eit will occur until the stable version 1.0 will be released.
From this version onwards there will hopefully only bugfixes and new features.

[tests]
If somebody wants to make unit tests with JUnit or so I would really appreciate it.
