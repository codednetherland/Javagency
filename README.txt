[purpose]
This library is not for the real performance maniacs.
It aims for straightforwardness in systems with a few parallel calculations.
Huge sysems with thousands of parallel things to do may come with later features.

[version]
The API here may change once in a while until the version 0.9 is complete.
If this happens a tag will show up and mark it.
Then maybe some issues or request to change it will occur until the stable version
1.0 will be released. From this version onwards there will hopefully only bugfixes
and new features.

[tests]
If somebody wants to make unit tests with JUnit or so I would really appreciate it.
